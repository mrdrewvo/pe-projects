# P.E. Mockup to Code Challenge

## Overview
This is a practice in translation a mockup to code.

## Background
Sometimes people tell us that - they’d have no problem making anything with HTML and CSS - as long as they didn’t have to make it up themselves. So can we emulate a visual-design/layout from an industry standard graphics program like Figma?

There are 3 versions of the same mockup template in the link below:

## Success Criteria
1. Ensure the CSS design system is powerful and resilient by using CSS custom properties. (What if the client changes the colors a few days later? Can up update that with a few lines of code?)
2. Ensure the architecture is solid, allowing full control, yet is as flexible as possible. (How does this system work? Which modules are mostly the same but just slightly different based on context? Which modules are definitely unique or use similar data? How should the data work? What are the best tools for the job?)
3. The Designer(s) should be able to easily navigate between the template styles by switching through them as 3 separate pages.


## Tasks
1. Decide link hover and click animations
2. Make smaller screen layouts
3. Dark mode
