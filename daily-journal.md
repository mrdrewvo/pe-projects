### Learnings

* From HTML, learned about the [title](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#properties) and [target](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_target.asp) attributes of an <a href> tag
* Found that simpler websites with more explicit CTAs are more effective
* in HTML files, references to links assume the same root folder as the current file - so you don't need the full URL!

### Open Questions
* How do I get this daily journal onto a server with markdown preview + git version control?

### How I feel

* Feeling nervous about all that I need to do for PE. I'm starting to feel a little lost. I think I'll schedule time with Derek and/or schedule more time for myself to work with my classmates.
* I'm pretty impressed I've gotten this far though, balancing family time, work, and school!

### What I learned

* Had more practice with setting up git
	* For the add command, the action occurs in the current directory so you don't need to rewrite the full file path again
 	* Got the hang of staging then commiting my daily journal entry
* Started HTML practice as well
	* Memorized the doc structure
	* Got some practice using basic features like links

	* can be edited like an HTML file
